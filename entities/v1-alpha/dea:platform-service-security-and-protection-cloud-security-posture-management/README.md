# Cloud Security Posture Management

> A Security and Protection platform service in the posture category, consumed by multiple application components as shared infrastructure or runtime capability. Admitted by CR-ISS-CAT-02 with three independent vendor corroborations; no vendor product is canonical (G-12).

## Identity

- **Id:** `dea:platform-service-security-and-protection-cloud-security-posture-management`
- **Type:** `PlatformService`
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Lifecycle:** active
- **Domain:** Security and Protection (`domain:security-and-protection`)
- **Category:** `posture`
- **Allocation:** `dea:entity-platform-service` (PS), layer L5, building_block L5-infrastructure, OpenDEAM v0.8.0

## Evidence

Three independent vendor corroborations (G-12: evidence only, no vendor product is canonical):

1. Amazon Web Services, AWS Security Hub (https://aws.amazon.com/products/)
2. Microsoft, Microsoft Defender for Cloud (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products)
3. Wiz, Wiz platform (https://www.wiz.io/platform)

Rationale: Three independent vendor corroborations of the Cloud Security Posture Management service class; vendor products are evidence only and never canonical (G-12).

## Classification-or-relationships

Tags: `domain:security-and-protection`, `category:posture`.

Deferred: no relationship instances are asserted at admission (FOUNDATIONS D-8). Cross-catalogue assertions, including platform-service specialisations recorded on the asserting side, land through later CRs once canonical targets exist.

## Provenance

Admission ladder (all stages 2026-11-12, actor Emmanuel A. Otchere):

Generated deterministically by `scripts/generate_ps_population.py` (G-10) from `scripts/ps_population_data.json`.
