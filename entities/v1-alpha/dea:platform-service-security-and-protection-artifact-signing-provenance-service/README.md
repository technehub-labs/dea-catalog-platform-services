# Artifact Signing and Provenance Service

> A Security and Protection platform service in the supply-chain-signing category, consumed by multiple application components as shared infrastructure or runtime capability. Admitted by CR-ISS-CAT-02 with three independent vendor corroborations; no vendor product is canonical (G-12).

## Identity

- **Id:** `dea:platform-service-security-and-protection-artifact-signing-provenance-service`
- **Type:** `PlatformService`
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Lifecycle:** active
- **Domain:** Security and Protection (`domain:security-and-protection`)
- **Category:** `supply-chain-signing`
- **Allocation:** `dea:entity-platform-service` (PS), layer L5, building_block L5-infrastructure, OpenDEAM v0.8.0

## Evidence

Three independent vendor corroborations (G-12: evidence only, no vendor product is canonical):

1. Sigstore, Sigstore cosign (https://www.sigstore.dev)
2. Chainguard, Chainguard (https://www.chainguard.dev)
3. SUSE, SUSE secure signing (https://www.suse.com/products/)

Rationale: Three independent vendor corroborations of the Artifact Signing and Provenance Service service class; vendor products are evidence only and never canonical (G-12).

## Classification-or-relationships

Tags: `domain:security-and-protection`, `category:supply-chain-signing`.

Deferred: no relationship instances are asserted at admission (FOUNDATIONS D-8). Cross-catalogue assertions, including platform-service specialisations recorded on the asserting side, land through later CRs once canonical targets exist.

## Provenance

Admission ladder (all stages 2026-11-12, actor Emmanuel A. Otchere):

Generated deterministically by `scripts/generate_ps_population.py` (G-10) from `scripts/ps_population_data.json`.
