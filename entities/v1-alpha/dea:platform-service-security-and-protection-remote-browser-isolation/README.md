# Remote Browser Isolation

> A Security and Protection platform service in the rbi category, consumed by multiple application components as shared infrastructure or runtime capability. Admitted by CR-ISS-CAT-02 with three independent vendor corroborations; no vendor product is canonical (G-12).

## Identity

- **Id:** `dea:platform-service-security-and-protection-remote-browser-isolation`
- **Type:** `PlatformService`
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Lifecycle:** active
- **Domain:** Security and Protection (`domain:security-and-protection`)
- **Category:** `rbi`
- **Allocation:** `dea:entity-platform-service` (PS), layer L5, building_block L5-infrastructure, OpenDEAM v0.8.0

## Evidence

Three independent vendor corroborations (G-12: evidence only, no vendor product is canonical):

1. Cloudflare, Cloudflare Browser Isolation (https://www.cloudflare.com/products/)
2. Menlo Security, Menlo Security (https://www.menlosecurity.com)
3. Broadcom, Symantec web isolation (https://www.broadcom.com/products/software)

Rationale: Three independent vendor corroborations of the Remote Browser Isolation service class; vendor products are evidence only and never canonical (G-12).

## Classification-or-relationships

Tags: `domain:security-and-protection`, `category:rbi`.

Deferred: no relationship instances are asserted at admission (FOUNDATIONS D-8). Cross-catalogue assertions, including platform-service specialisations recorded on the asserting side, land through later CRs once canonical targets exist.

## Provenance

Generated deterministically by `scripts/generate_ps_population.py` (G-10) from `scripts/ps_population_data.json`.
