# Environmental Condition Monitoring

> A IoT and Edge platform service in the environment category, consumed by multiple application components as shared infrastructure or runtime capability. Admitted by CR-ISS-CAT-02 with three independent vendor corroborations; no vendor product is canonical (G-12).

## Identity

- **Id:** `dea:platform-service-iot-and-edge-environmental-condition-monitoring`
- **Type:** `PlatformService`
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Lifecycle:** active
- **Domain:** IoT and Edge (`domain:iot-and-edge`)
- **Category:** `environment`
- **Allocation:** `dea:entity-platform-service` (PS), layer L5, building_block L5-infrastructure, OpenDEAM v0.8.0

## Evidence

Three independent vendor corroborations (G-12: evidence only, no vendor product is canonical):

1. Samsara, Samsara environmental monitors (https://www.samsara.com)
2. Tive, Tive (https://www.tive.com)
3. Disruptive Technologies, Disruptive Technologies sensors (https://www.disruptive-technologies.com)

Rationale: Three independent vendor corroborations of the Environmental Condition Monitoring service class; vendor products are evidence only and never canonical (G-12).

## Classification-or-relationships

Tags: `domain:iot-and-edge`, `category:environment`.

Deferred: no relationship instances are asserted at admission (FOUNDATIONS D-8). Cross-catalogue assertions, including platform-service specialisations recorded on the asserting side, land through later CRs once canonical targets exist.

## Provenance

Admission ladder (all stages 2026-11-12, actor Emmanuel A. Otchere):

candidate, corroborated, reviewed, canonical.

Generated deterministically by `scripts/generate_ps_population.py` (G-10) from `scripts/ps_population_data.json`.
